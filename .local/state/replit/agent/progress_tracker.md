## AI-Based Doctor Matching System

### Overview
The system automatically analyzes patient symptoms and medical report descriptions to detect the appropriate medical specialization, then assigns a doctor from that specialty. This creates a many-to-many relationship between patients and doctors stored in the `sharedReports` collection.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Doctor Specialization Support
- Added `specialization` field to User schema
- Doctors can have specializations like:
  - Dermatologist (skin conditions)
  - Cardiologist (heart & cardiovascular)
  - Orthopedic (bones & joints)
  - Neurologist (brain & nerves)
  - Gastroenterologist (digestive system)
  - Pulmonologist (respiratory system)
  - Endocrinologist (hormones & metabolism)
  - Ophthalmologist (eyes)
  - ENT Specialist (ear, nose, throat)
  - General Physician (default)

#### 2. AI Symptom Analysis
- Keyword-based detection with 100+ medical terms
- Analyzes symptoms, summary, and description fields
- Confidence scoring based on keyword matches
- Automatic fallback to General Physician

#### 3. POST /api/uploadReport Endpoint
**URL**: `/api/uploadReport`
**Method**: POST
**Authentication**: Required

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "patientId": "patient-uuid",
  "reportURL": "https://example.com/report.pdf",
  "symptoms": "Patient complaining of chest pain and palpitations",
  "summary": "ECG shows irregular heartbeat",
  "description": "Optional detailed description"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Report uploaded and assigned successfully",
  "reportId": "shared-report-uuid",
  "shareToken": "unique-token",
  "assignedDoctor": {
    "id": "doctor-uuid",
    "name": "Dr. John Smith",
    "email": "doctor@example.com",
    "specialization": "Cardiologist"
  },
  "aiDetection": {
    "detectedSpecialization": "Cardiologist",
    "confidence": "high"
  },
  "reportDetails": {
    "patientId": "patient-uuid",
    "reportURL": "https://example.com/report.pdf",
    "symptoms": "...",
    "summary": "..."
  },
  "expiresAt": "2026-01-18T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### How to Register Doctors with Specializations

**IMPORTANT**: For the AI matching to work, you must register doctors with their specialization field set.

#### Option 1: Register via API (Recommended)
```javascript
// POST /api/auth/register
{
  "email": "doctor@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "role": "doctor",
  "specialization": "Cardiologist"  // ← IMPORTANT: Set this field!
}
```

#### Option 2: Update Existing Doctor Accounts
If you have existing doctor accounts without specialization:
1. Use Firestore Console to manually add the `specialization` field
2. Or create an admin endpoint to update doctor profiles
3. The specialization must match one of the supported values exactly

#### Option 3: Create Test Doctors
For testing, you can create multiple doctors with different specializations:

```bash
# Example: Create a Cardiologist
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "cardiologist@test.com",
    "password": "test123",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Cardio",
    "role": "doctor",
    "specialization": "Cardiologist"
  }'

# Example: Create a Dermatologist
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "dermatologist@test.com",
    "password": "test123",
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "lastName": "Skin",
    "role": "doctor",
    "specialization": "Dermatologist"
  }'
```

### Many-to-Many Relationship via sharedReports

The `sharedReports` collection now stores the doctor-patient mapping:

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  userId: "patient-id",           // Original patient who owns the report
  shareToken: "unique-token",     // Secure access token
  doctorEmail: "doctor@email",    // Doctor's email
  expiresAt: "2026-01-18",       // 90 days expiration
  isActive: true,                 // Active status
  viewCount: 0,                   // How many times viewed
  
  // Extended fields for AI matching:
  patientId: "patient-id",        // Explicit patient reference
  doctorId: "doctor-id",          // Explicit doctor reference
  reportURL: "https://...",       // Link to the report
  detectedSpecialization: "Cardiologist",  // AI-detected specialty
  reportSummary: "ECG analysis...", // Summary text
  symptoms: "chest pain...",      // Patient symptoms
  description: "Additional notes..." // Extra details
}
```

### Testing the AI Matching System

1. **Create test doctors** with different specializations (see above)

2. **Upload a report** with symptoms:
```javascript
// Example: Should match with Cardiologist
POST /api/uploadReport
{
  "patientId": "your-patient-id",
  "reportURL": "https://example.com/ecg-report.pdf",
  "symptoms": "chest pain, palpitations, high blood pressure",
  "summary": "ECG shows irregular heartbeat pattern",
  "description": "Patient reports dizziness and shortness of breath"
}
```

3. **Check the response** to see:
   - Which specialization was detected
   - Which doctor was assigned
   - The confidence level

4. **Verify in Firestore**:
   - Check the `sharedReports` collection
   - Confirm the doctor-patient mapping exists
   - Verify all fields are populated

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "No doctor found with specialization: X"**
- **Solution**: Register doctors with the detected specialization or General Physician

**Issue: AI detects wrong specialization**
- **Solution**: Add more specific keywords to symptoms/description
- The AI uses keyword matching, so clear medical terms work best

**Issue: All reports go to General Physician**
- **Solution**: Use more specific medical terminology in symptoms field
- Example: Instead of "pain", use "chest pain" or "abdominal pain"

**Issue: Doctor assignment fails with database error**
- **Solution**: Ensure doctors are stored in the `doctors` collection in Firestore
- Verify the doctor has `role: 'doctor'` and a valid `specialization` field
